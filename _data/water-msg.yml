    msg-desc: Additional Update by Jon. This is Info. Comfy with the quick-hit
      message change & delete - intuititive, in line with philosophy of allowing
      Water Owners (or at least not just (Jason) to effect quick updates. I'd be
      knocking out a few tweaks as a matter of course (for review) here & there.
      Downside is risk of losing the true "corporate consistency if not running
      thru same person, but part of review prior to live.

      Another **Jon** Message - this is danger. Wonder, can you change Text
      Colour. Can see how to import a photo - via upload of "Asset". Assume cant
      see the Assets as very restricted Demo extract of site. (i.e. the messages
      only @ present.

      Grove is open!!!!
