          <p>NUAC are very pleased to announce we have gained access to the River Wensum at Taverham Mills Fishery commencing Thursday 16th June.</p>
          <p>This beautiful ¾ mile stretch of the Wensum includes two weir pools as well as deep pools, shallow gravel runs, lilies, reeds and snaggy stretches.</p>
          <p>In order to fish this stretch please familiarise yourself with the <a href="../waters/taverham.html#water-rules">rules</a> before making a <a href="../waters/taverham.html#water-booking">booking</a>. We would love to know how you get on, please send catch reports to <a href="mailto:bookings@nuac.org.uk">bookings@nuac.org.uk</a>.</p>
          <p>The Committee hopes members find access to this part of the river an exciting prospect – special thanks to new Committee member Scott Swift who has been instrumental in securing access to this water.</p>
          <p>We continue to prospect for new venues so please let the Committee know if you become aware of any opportunities that might complement the fishing already available to the Club. Contact details can be found <a href="../info/committee.html">here</a>.</p>

          <h2>Tuesday 17th May</h2>

          </ul>
          <p>The deadline for raising proposed changes to The Constitution, Nominations for Officers of The Club, New Committee Members, and confirmation of attendance is no later than <strong>Tuesday 3rd May</strong>.</p>
          <p>Nominations & Proposers must be in attendance on the evening.</p>
          <p>In the interest of helping to ensure we keep to time, advance notification of Any Other Business you wish to raise would be much appreciated. Of course, you will still be able to raise AOB on the night.</p>
          <h4>Outstanding Action</h4>
          <p>At last year’s AGM I asked if anyone was willing to take up the outstanding action of running a Memorial match for Mike Hoyland & Simon Clay. I received no response and the Committee plans to adopt the following Awards to honour Mike & Simon’s contribution to the club:</p>
          <p><u>Mike Hoyland Award</u><br>This will be awarded for The Most Unexpected Carp Capture in a season.  To qualify, nominees must have been fishing for another species or general fishing.  A picture of the carp including rod/reel in the shot and a write-up of the capture is required. It's more than likely that the funnier the capture, the more favourable will be the Committee view.</p>
          <p><u>Simon Clay Award</u><br>This Award is for the best Broads catch or the best non-carp specimen from a NUAC water.  Again, photo evidence will be required, and the story of the day will be of great interest.</p>
          <p>The Committee may not make an award every year and winning submissions will be recorded via our Website News and Facebook pages (fishery publicity rules permitting). Nominations for the 2021-22 Season are invited.</p>
          <h4>Venue</h4>
          <p>After the last couple of years, the Committee are delighted to be able to make a welcome return to the The Worlds End pub.  The club isn't providing any refreshments, but The Worlds End has an extensive <a href="https://theworldsendpub.co.uk/our-menu">menu</a> which can be ordered at the bar. If you plan to eat before the meeting, please indicate in your confirmation so that we can inform The Worlds End of numbers.</p>
          <p>To confirm your attendance, please email the <a href="mailto:secretary@nuac.org.uk">Secretary</a>. </p>
          <p>Many thanks, <br>Jon</p>

          <p>The Club are pleased to confirm that access to Bridge Inn Fishery and Hall Walk Lakes has been renewed for another season.</p>
          <p>As you may know BIF has removed Day Ticket access and fishing is now available via Syndicate Ticket only (starting Friday 1st April).  This change has removed BIF's booking system, which means NUAC members can just email their booking request as per the updated <a href="../waters/bridge.html#water-booking">instructions</a>.</p>
          <p>No immediate change to our access at Hall Walk Lakes.  The pike fishing on Tom's Lake this winter proved popular and a big thanks to Chris Mack for allowing NUAC this access (just a reminder that this was NOT included via our Silver Ticket access).  We haven't had confirmation that access to Tom's will be repeated in 2022-23 but we will keep you informed.</p>

                  href="https://www.norfolkwildlifetrust.org.uk/news-and-articles/news/all-news/2020-12-09-killer-shrimp-discovered-in-tr">Trinity
                  Broads.</a></p>
              <p>Killer shrimp is so called due to its voracious habits: eating or killing any of our native invertebrates small enough to be prey. Growing to 3cm long, adults will feed on fish eggs and fry as well.</p>
              <p>In order to minimise/slow the spread of this non-native species it is imperative that all anglers take the following steps</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Check</strong> your gear after leaving the water for mud, aquatic animals or plant material. Remove anything you find and leave it at the site.</li>
                <li><strong>Clean</strong> everything thoroughly as soon as you can, paying attention to nets, waders, and areas that are damp and hard to access. Use hot water if possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Dry</strong> everything for as long as possible before using elsewhere as some invasive plants and animals can survive for two weeks in damp conditions.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>More information about killer shrimp and other non-native species is available via the <a
                  href="http://www.nonnativespecies.org/checkcleandry/non-native-species-to-look-out-for.cfm">Non-Native Species Secretariat.</a></p>

          <p>We have been unable to inspect the water, or undertake any work on the water for some months, but the majority of swims should be fishable before the "spurt" of spring growth. There is no issue in taking a swim rake or secateurs to be used in the immediate surround in order to make fishing comfortable.</p>
          <p>We will look toward the usual water maintenance work on the lake in due course, and whilst there may be a request for help, work will be planned and undertaken at short notice; apologies in advance for any inconvenience this may cause.</p>

          <p>Please note that Bridge Inn Fishery have adopted a new booking system and the Club will be using this system on behalf of our members when you book this venue.</p>
          <p>To help simplify the end-to-end booking process we would be grateful if members please check availability at Bridge Inn <strong>BEFORE</strong> emailing NUAC your booking request.</p>
          <p>To do this please go to BIF <a href="https://www.ibookfishing.com/booking/bridge-inn-fisheries" target="_blank">Bookings</a> (this system can also be accessed via the Shop button on <a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/The-Bridge-Inn-Fishery-164399460336159/">BIF Facebook</a>).</p>
          <p>Scroll to the bottom of the page to see a calendar which shows availability across the three BIF venues (Main, Pleasure & River).  Select the <code>Show Month</code> option to show availablity by day. Day cells that are not greyed out indicate swims are available.  If you are using a PC/Laptop you can place your cursor over a cell to display a message indicating how many swims are still available.</p>
          <p>Assuming the days you require are not greyed out then please email <a href="mailto:bookings@nuac.org.uk">bookings@nuac.org.uk</a> indicating your chosen BIF Venue, Date & Time.</p>
          <p>When a booking is confirmed the associated email we send you will include three pdf attachments: An Invoice, The Fishery Rules and a <strong>BIF Permit</strong> for your visit.  You <strong>MUST have this Permit</strong> with you when you fish at Bridge Inn (either on your phone or printed off beforehand); this will enable the bailiff to confirm your booking.</p>
          <p>This is a new system for those of us on the Bookings Roster. Please be patient as there may be teething problems while we familiarise ourselves with this new process.  May we also remind members to provide at least 24 hours notice (from the start of your planned visit) otherwise we cannot guarantee your booking will be processed on time.</p>

          <p>Since the start of the National Lockdown the Government have clarified that angling can continue as a form of exercise. Travel for exercise is governed by strict restrictions requiring you to stay local “meaning avoiding travelling outside of your village, town or the part of a city where you live”.</p>
          <p>Given the severity of the situation we would like to help with this lockdown by not encouraging travel any further than necessary. So we have taken the decision to keep our waters/facilities closed at this time.</p>
          <p>We apologise to those members who live down the road from any of our waters/boats - we are trying to be fair to all and we would rather see you out fishing when safe to do so than not.</p>
          <p>This decision will be reviewed once Government travel restrictions for exercise/recreation are relaxed.</p>
          <p>Thanks for your support in this matter.</p>

We appreciate that arriving at a fishery to find you cannot fish is frustrating, but the restrictions fisheries must apply are there for people’s safety.</p>
          <p>When fishing please follow fishery rules and please familiarise yourself with the Angling Trust guidance to ensure that you protect yourself and your loved ones.  Links to this guidance are now available on the website via each water currently open.</p>
          <p>The Grove remains closed for the foreseeable future.  Given the period of time since we had access to this fishery there will be plenty of work required to clear pegs ready for fishing.  As soon as we are allowed the club intends running a series of working parties to carry out the necessary maintenance.  Please follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Norwich-Union-Angling-Club-222668947831657/">Facebook</a> to be notified when these working parties will take place.</p>
          <p>Thank you again for your ongoing support & co-operation.</p>

          <p>First an update regards situation following the easing of Government Covid-19 restrictions.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Shallowbrook is now open for night fishing although NUAC members are still restricted to Snipe Lake.</li>
            <li>Bridge Inn Fishery is now open and can be booked as per our website instructions (bookings no longer limited to 24 hours).</li>
            <li>Snetterton Pits have confirmed they will not re-open until 16th June (so please renew your membership if you want to fish here).</li>

          <p>Please note that fisheries have had to reduce the number of pegs available so we cannot guarantee you will be able to fish even when making a booking.  We appreciate that arriving at a fishery to find you cannot fish is frustrating but the restrictions fisheries must apply are there for people’s safety.</p>
          <p>When fishing please follow fishery rules and please familiarise yourself with the Angling Trust <a href="https://joinanglingtrust.net/individual-anglers-phase-one-may-2020/">guidance</a> to ensure that you protect yourself and your loved ones.  Links to this guidance are now available on the website via each water currently open.</p>
          <p>Additional to limiting the waters available to you, this public health emergency has had other impacts on the running of the club.  May is usually about our Annual General Meeting (AGM), work at The Grove, and Renewals.  Only Renewals are proceeding as normal, and I hope you are optimistic about prospects for our sport; it will help our planning hugely by renewing as soon as you can.</p>
          <p>We will take a view around timing of the AGM; access to a venue & getting together is only part of it, and we need other face to face preparation ahead of Public Meetings recommencing.</p>
          <p>AGM is a chance to record The Club's thanks to any of the Committee who have decided to relinquish their roles.  This year we have three of our Committee stepping down;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Dave Shearing relinquishes his roles as Hickling & Snetterton Manager.  Dave's the definition of a "proper" fisherman with his enthusiasm for all branches of the sport from boats on the Broads to Match Fishing.  He has looked after our Hickling relationship for many years, obtained our past access to AlphaCraft,and more recently River Yare & Snetterton. He's ferreted out more prospects for us to check out than the rest of the Committee put together, and taken Minutes more than a few times as well.</li>
            <li>Dave Crooks has appeared as "Web Wizard" on our Website for many, many years and was systematic behind the development of the tech behind our on-line presence.</li>
            <li>Michael Stolworthy, who has managed our relationships with Hall Walk, The Bridge, and The Wensum (having brokered access to this stretch for us this time last year). </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Hopefully a proper thank-you can be expressed in the not too-distant future.</p>
          <p>Whilst the Club is really healthy, if the Committee changes above imply significant loss, that's very true. Our Committee is thin; more consultancy is being undertaken (and decisions made) by fewer of us; we need capacity to maintain & manage our successful, small club.</p>
          <p>So if you feel you could help in keeping our Bookings responsive, help on the ground (The Grove), help in managing Fishery Owner relationships, or help in our administration - either as a Committee Member, or without the commitment of attending our meetings, please contact our Secretary (<a href="mailto:secretary@nuac.org.uk">secretary@nuac.org.uk</a>) or any <a href="../info/committee.html">Committee</a> Member for a chat.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your ongoing support & co-operation.</p>
          <p>Keep safe,<br>Jon</p>

          <p>Following the latest Government announcements regards Covid-19 restrictions we will be allowed to travel to a fishery and fish from tomorrow, Wednesday 13th May.</p>
          <p>
            The Government is still mandating social distancing restrictions when people are outside the home and the Angling Trust have provided <a href="https://joinanglingtrust.net/clubs-phase-one-may-2020/">guidance to clubs</a> and <a href="https://joinanglingtrust.net/individual-anglers-phase-one-may-2020/">anglers</a> as to what that means when fishing.  The committee have reviewed this guidance and information supplied by our partner fisheries and can confirm that from tomorrow Snipe Lake at Shallowbrook will be open to NUAC members.</p>
          <p>
            To help Shallowbrook manage numbers and maintain social distancing NUAC have chosen to restrict our members to Snipe Lake.  This decision will be reviewed in the next week or two and you will be notified of any change as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>
            Shallowbrook have imposed the following restrictions:
            <ul>
              <li>Fishing restricted to daytime from 8am until 7pm.</li>
              <li>Please provide your own hand sanitiser.</li>
              <li>Please observe all government social distancing requirements.</li>
              <li>One fisherman per swim, unless 2 people from the same household want to fish.</li>
              <li>No spectators or dogs at this present time.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            These restrictions take precedent over existing fishery rules as stated at <a href="../waters/shallowbrook.html">nuac.org.uk</a>.  Please continue to follow all the existing fishery rules where applicable.  We recommend you follow Shallowbrook on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/shallowbrooklakes/">Facebook</a> to keep informed of further rule changes.</p>
          <p>
            Regrettably The Grove will remain closed for the foreseeable future.  A number of factors influenced this decision not least of which is its location within the grounds of a Care Home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hall Walk, Bridge Inn Fishery & Snetterton Pits also remain closed to our members at this time.  We expect them to re-open in the next few weeks and we will communicate these changes to you as soon as we can.  Please be patient while these fisheries take the necessary steps to minimise the risks posed by the Covid-19 virus; this work is necessary to ensure your safety when you return.
          </p>
          <p>
            All our other venues remain closed due to the river close season and as such will be unavailable to 2019-20 permit holders (you will receive a renewal invite in the next 7 days).
          </p>
          <p>
            In the meantime please familiarise yourself with the <a href="https://joinanglingtrust.net/individual-anglers-phase-one-may-2020/">Angling Trust guidance</a> to ensure that you protect yourself and your loved ones when you do go fishing.

          <p>Just a quick note to inform you that Wroxham DAC will no longer be providing boats on the River Bure at
            Wroxham. Unfortunately this facility was not utilised enough by the Wroxham members to justify the ongoing
            expense, and this poor utilisation was borne out by NUAC's usage; just 12 outings by 4 members in 2019-20
            compared with 27 trips by 8 members in 2018-19. Obviously this means that this facility will not be
            available to NUAC members in 2020-21.</p>
          <p>
            As ever the committee are keen to replace this facility at the earliest opportunity. If you are aware of a
            suitable replacement then please let the committee know (contacts as per the <a href="../info/committee.html">website</a>).</p>

            <p>NUAC are very pleased to announce we have secured access to two stretches of the River Wensum at Drayton.</p>
            <p>From the start of the river season members can access the majority of the northern bank sandwiched between Taverham Mill and Costessey Mill - nearly 2.5km of fishing accessed via grazed fields. A further 750m of river running below Drayton Low Road, accessed from the southern bank is also available. This stretch is a little more wild with it being accessed over un-grazed land.</p>
            <p>Your Committee has been keen to obtain access to a non-tidal river stretch and hope members see this as a valuable and different addition to the choice of fishing on offer.</p>
            <p>The land is all part of a working farm, and it is essential members are familiar with Parking and Rules before visiting;  these can be found on the <a href="../waters/wensum.html">website</a> along with detailed maps to help you. Please ensure you display your Parking Permit when visiting these stretches of river.</p>
            <p>In order to fish either stretch please follow our <a href="../waters/wensum.html#water-booking">booking instructions</a>. Please let us know how you get on by sending a catch report to <a href="mailto:bookings@nuac.org.uk">bookings@nuac.org.uk</a> or posting to our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Norwich-Union-Angling-Club/222668947831657" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>.</p>
            <p>The committee hopes members find access to this part of the river an exciting prospect – special thanks go to Michael Stolworthy who has been instrumental in securing NUAC’s access to this water.</p>
            <p>We continue to prospect for new venues so please let the committee know if you become aware of any opportunities that might complement the fishing already available to the club. Contact details can be found <a href="../info/committee.html">here</a>.</p>

          <p>The committee are pleased to announce that NUAC members can now book access to Norwich & District Anglers Association waters.  This new arrangement provides access to NDAA stretches of the Rivers Ant, Bure & Thurne along with boat fishing on Decoy Broad.
          <p>
          The river stretches are tidal and provide plenty of silver fish sport to float and feeder tactics especially at this time of year;  Saturday's Broads Open was won from peg 1 of the NDAA's stretch of the Bure at St. Benets with a cracki38lb net of roach & skimmers.  Fishing at Decoy Broad is via rowing boat which can be hired for just £6 per day.

          Just to clarify access to the lakes at Snetterton Pits, as per recent email communication (news item dated 03/12/2017 below).
          <p>
          Of the seven lakes on this complex only six will be available to a NUAC member once they've booked their Day Ticket.
          <p>
          Mallard Lake is NOT available to NUAC members.
          <p>
          The website has been updated to reflect this clarification <a href="../waters/snetterton.html">here</a>.
          <p>

          The committee are pleased to announce that NUAC have secured Day Ticket access to Snetterton Pits near Attleborough. These pits consist of 6 lakes of various sizes which contain a good head of specimen carp, tench, bream, pike, roach arudd.  The pits are ordinarily only available via Syndicate Permit however NUAC have negotiated Day Ticket access withe owner, Mr James Cooke.  Day Tickets will be charged at £10 each and must be booked in advance as per the booking instructions which may be found <a href="../waters/snetterton.html">here</a>.
          <p>
          A number of committee members have visited these lakes since spring and had varying degrees of success.  This initial arrangement is a chance for NUAC to determine what these lakes offer and assess the demand from our membership.  If the venue proves of value to our members then NUAC would be keen to make these lakes accessible without the need for a Day Ticket.  With this in mind please would anyone visiting these lakes report the outcome of their trip to Dave Shearing via phone (01953-681096) or email (<a href="mailto:djshearing@live.co.uk">djshearing@live.co.uk</a>).
          <p>
          Many thanks to Dave Shearing for brokering this deal with Mr Cooke.  As ever NUAC is keen to gain access to new venues so please let the committee know (contacts as per the <a href="../info/committee.html">website</a>) if you become aware of any suitable venues.
          <p>
          Many thanks

          We are pleased to announce that NUAC have agreed with Wroxham & District Angling Club the use of one of their boats moored at Wroxham on the River Bure.
          <p>
          Booking is via Wroxham & District Angling Club, details of which may be found <a href="../waters/bure.html">here</a>.
          <p>
          The boat may need bailing especially after heavy rainfall and it is advisable to take a bailer just in case they have been taken from the boats.
          <p>
          The boat gives access to excellent Bream, Roach, and Perch fishing.  Lure fishing for Pike during the summer earAutumn was good last season and numerous 20lb plus Pike caught in the area during the winter (Myself and Jon Weyer were lucky enough to catch a couple of these on the same day!).
          <p>
          As with any of our waters it is important for your feedback especially as bookings are done through W&DAC so please let us know how you get on.

            <p>Please note that NUAC have secured access to the Great Yarmouth & Norfolk County AA stretch of the River Yare from Claxton to Langley.  With immediate effect NUAC members now have access to nearly 3 miles of the River Yare as detailed on our <a href="../waters/yare.html">website</a></p>
            <p>
            Please ensure you familiarise yourself with the rules (as indicated on the website) before visiting and please note that access to the river to the left of the Beauchamp Arms is out of bounds at this time of year (these pegs are closed from 1st October until 15th June inclusive).</p>
            <p>
            This stretch of the river is primarily a match water and as such pleasure anglers must avoid pegs booked for match use.  GYNCAA match bookings for the remainder of the river season can be found via their <a href="http://www.riveryare.co.uk/events/all-matches/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

            As per Postwick previously this stretch of river will prove a little temperamental at this time of year.  Get the conditions right though, preferably when the water has some colour after a few days rain, then the skimmers and bream will provide some bumper sport.  And fishing into darkness should also provide a few bites even when the river is running clear.</p>

            The committee believes that this new access goes some way to replacing the Postwick stretch of the river (although the club is still striving to recover this access at the earliest opportunity).  Many thanks to Dave Shearing for brokering this deal with GYNCAA.  As ever NUAC is keen to gain access to new venues so please let the committee know (contacts as per the <a href="../info/committee.html">website</a>) if you become aware of any suitable venues.</p>
