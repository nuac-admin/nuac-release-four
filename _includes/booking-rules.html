                <li>Only 2 advance bookings can be in place at any one time for any member. Either two separate days or one consecutive two-day period.

                <li>Whole day booking is from 08:00 on the first day to 08:00 on the following day. This enables overnight fishing on those venues where night fishing is allowed.</li>
                <li>If you are only planning a part day, please state the approximate period you would be on the water. For example if you were just going for the morning, we might be able to release the ticket to someone else who fancies going for the afternoon.</li>
