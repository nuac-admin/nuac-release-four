          - txt: The island lake has been stocked over the years with Carp up to 16lb, these fish are now into the twenties. There is a good head of Carp around 8-12lb so a double figure fish is not too hard to come by. The lake also contains some decent Tench which are a natural stocking and have been present in the lake for decades so the true size remains to be seen.
