            <h3>Tom's Lake</h3>
            <p>Tom’s lake is the largest of the three lake complex at approx. 9 acres. A mature gravel pit containing many interesting features with islands, reed beds, gravel bars and lilies. There are still a couple of originally stocked carp that weighed in at 40lb, but these are now old fish and not as heavy, but it does show the potential that Tom’s Lake has. The young carp in there now are pushing close to 30lb and growing fast.</p>
            <p>It also boasts great winter pike weighing in at well over 20lb. There are also bream and tench to 10lb and large rudd and roach.</p>

            <h3>Long Lake</h3>
            <p>This 2.5 acre lake is the first lake to the left of the Hall Walk access track.  It has an island and two large reed beds at the far end of the lake and provides 15 swims, with depths between 3' - 6'.</p>
            <p>This is a true mixed fishery with an original stock of roach, rudd, pike, perch and a few tench & eels.  In February 2009 the existing stock was supplemented with approx 90 bream plus an additional 300 lbs of silver fish, another 20 tench and a further stocking of 430 small carp of around 14 oz.	</p>

            <h3>Puppy Lake</h3>
            <p>Puppy Lake is just under 2 acres with an island and 12 swims.  The water is accessed from the car park at the far end of the access track. A shallow water with only 3' - 4' at the end nearest the track it deepens to 5'+ at the far end.</p>
            <p>This was stocked in March 2008 with 116 quality English scaley carp averaging about 8.5 lbs. As of 2017 these fish are now in the 15 - 20 lbs range. Although it was only stocked with carp the lake is teeming with roach and rudd that can prove troublesome when using soft hook baits.</p>
