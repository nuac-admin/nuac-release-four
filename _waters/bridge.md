      	    <h3>Main Lake</h3>
            <p>This is a mature gravel pit of approximately 5 acres in size with 20 swims and is full of features such as an island, gravel bars & lilies all of which offer the perfect environment for our fish. There are 200 to 250 carp, the average is 19lb, a good head of twenties, and some go over the magical 30lb mark.</p>

            <h3>Pleasure Lake</h3>
            <p>A small pleasure lake with 15 pegs, heavily stocked with a mix of roach, rudd, skimmers, perch, carp, tench and even a few crucians. With depths of only 3ft max this makes it ideal for youngsters to learn our sport.</p>
