          - txt: Nominations & Proposers must be in attendance on the evening.
          - txt: In the interest of helping to ensure we keep to time, advance notification of Any Other Business you wish to raise would be much appreciated. Of course, you will still be able to raise AOB on the night.
          - txt: Nominations for the Mike Hoyland and Simon Clay awards are still welcome, see the following descriptions for a reminder of the qualifying criteria. Please send your nominations to the [Secretary](mailto:secretary@nuac.org.uk) before midnight Tuesday 9th May.
          - txt: <u>Mike Hoyland Award</u><br>This will be awarded for The Most Unexpected Carp Capture in a season.  To qualify, nominees must have been fishing for another species or general fishing.  A picture of the carp including rod/reel in the shot and a write-up of the capture is required.  It's more than likely that the funnier the capture, the more favourable will be the Committee view.
          - txt: Nominations received - none (yet).
          - txt: <u>Simon Clay Award</u><br>This Award is for the best Broads catch or the best non-carp specimen from a NUAC water.  Again, photo evidence will be required, and the story of the day will be of great interest.
          - txt: Nominations received - Colin Heinen.
          - txt: The Committee may not make an award every year and winning submissions will be recorded via our Website News and Facebook pages (fishery publicity rules permitting).
          - txt: Fancy eating before the meeting?
          - txt: The club will not be providing any refreshments, but The Worlds End has an extensive [menu](https://theworldsendpub.co.uk/#af4f5cb2-2096-4687-9e82-af775a000614) which can be ordered at the bar.  If you plan to eat before the meeting, please indicate in your confirmation so that we can inform The Worlds End of numbers.
          - txt: To confirm your attendance, please email the [Secretary](mailto:secretary@nuac.org.uk).
          - txt: Many thanks, <br>Jon
